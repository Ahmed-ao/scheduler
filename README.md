# scheduler
Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

This is my first post, sharing with you an open source SPA I built https://lnkd.in/gGUK3wtZ . This Web Application has been built and tested with this set of technologies ( React, Sass, Storybook, Jest, Cypress) and a few other libraries. The source code is available at https://lnkd.in/gbiDPBs5 

The scheduler app as the name suggests is about booking an appointment with the employers, every employer has a number of spots available during each given day. Absolutely the application provides all crud operations.You can check the images for below. 
The application is hosted on Linux using Nodejs as a back-end. I have many upgrading Ideas for it such as gradually adding Typescript to it or adding support for sending text messages with Twilio to let both the employer and candidate get notified before the scheduled date.

It has been built during a boot-camp ( Web development ) at https://lnkd.in/gAMrHDUj where we are exposed to different concepts and technologies that are being used in modern web apps.  

This app is live on Netlify and the source code on GitHub. At the moment itâ€™s built using only JavaScript, my plans are to gradually add Typescript to it.

Any feedback is welcome. As long as it's respectful, Iâ€™m here to grow. And for every employer out there Iâ€™m open to work.

Thanks for taking the time to read through the post, and I hope to see you in my next post.
